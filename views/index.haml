      This is a sample app showing how the customized image dialog could look.  Try it by focusing on the text area (so there is a cursor showing), then click the image dialog button.  Then click on an image to insert it into the editor.  The insertion template (with the caption and horiz-rule) are defined in the customized javascript.  You'll see a list of images (using http://placeholder.it images) It's pulling from a local endpoint called 
      %code attachable_images
      which returns a list of images as json 
      %span.tip{ title: '{ background: "0d2150", caption: "This image is 50x50 and uses colors #6ECC43 and #0d2150", file: "http://placehold.it/50/6ECC43/0d2150", foreground: "6ECC43" }' } 
      (hover for a sample entry).
      The data is used to populate a Javascript template for the image dialog.
